        "We extend the existing body of research in predictive business process monitoring, by testing" +
        " four different variants of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and a fully connected Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)" +
        " with dropout for the tasks of predicting the nature and timestamp of the next process activity. " +
        "This provides new insights into the performance of a prediction model, as they behave differently at different stages of a business-process."
